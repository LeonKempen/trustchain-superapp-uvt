# DeToks: Upvote Token

DeToks is a decentralized TikTok skeleton application where several different groups implemented parts of the application. The application will utilize a peer-to-peer network consisting strictly of smartphones only. Currently, the application only works on Android-powered smartphones. The focus of this application will be the token economy, Torrent-based streaming videos, and basic app logic. Our responsibility for the project was the Upvote Token, and we will explain the components of this functionality in this README. 

We will also show screenshots of the actions which are possible in our implementation:
